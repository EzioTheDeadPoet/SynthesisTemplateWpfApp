# SynthesisTemplateWpfApp

This is a template for getting started writing your own WPF UI app that hooks into the Synthesis systems.

Note that this is mainly targeted towards developers with patchers that have very complex settings that need custom love.  Most developers can just lean on the [autogenerated settings setup](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/wiki/User-Input#automatic-settings-ui-system) offered by Synthesis instead of writing a custom UI.

This project shows off a few bits of intersecting tech:
- WPF, a UI framework from Microsoft
	Some alternative C# UI technologies not covered here:
	- Avalonia
	- Blazor
	- MAUI
- RxUI, a library to facilitate Reactive Extension API usage within UIs
    - Easily follow when properties change and execute logic
	- Create derivative properties that are readonly and driven by other properties
	- General Reactive patterns and upsides, such as fluent patterns, easier threading
	- Can also replace XAML binding with code, if desired
- Autofac as the Inversion of Control container
    - Allows for different jobs to live more easily in different files, without needing to make the classes static or pass them around as parameters.
- Synthesis Pipeline
    - Interpret incoming command line arguments to know what way to start the application
	
Many of these technologies are optional or swappable.  For example, Autofac might be too confusing and unnecessary for a very simple app.  Feel free to remove it if you want to digest less new tech at once.
